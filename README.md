## How to share your Letter

  - copy your `shared_key_uuid` , which is required for the following steps

- If you are familiar with GitHub contribution model:
  - raise a Pull Request with the content of your Letter and translations
    - `letters/your-shared-key-uuid.md`
- If you are NOT familiar with GitHub:
    - just raise a new [Issue](https://github.com/mindwarriorgame/shared-letters/issues) here
    - in the issue, please provide your `shared_key_uuid`, your Letter and the translations (if any)
 
## Translations

By default, all letters are translated with ChatGPT. If you want, please feel free to submit your own translations. For that insert the language code before `.md` extension (e.g. `my-uuid.ru.md`)

## How to modify a Letter

If you have spotted a typo, or wanted to modify your own Letter, please feel free to submit another PR (or an Issue explaining the change).

## Privacy considerations

Since we have asked for your `shared_key_uuid` , even though it doesn't contain any sensitive information about yourself (a random string), this might raise a Privacy concern. To address that, you could always regenerate `shared_key_uuid` for your playing account by sending `regenerate_shared_key_uuid` command to the bot. 

We ask you to do that only after your Letter has been merged to the codebase of the repository, because otherwise we won't be able to check the requirements for Letter about the positive scores and the active game length.
