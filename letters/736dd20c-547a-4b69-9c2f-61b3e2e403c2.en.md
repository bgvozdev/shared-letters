# Right now, you're most likely in a clouded state of mind

- You're worrying about things that don't exist (the past and the future).
- You're concerned with fleeting pleasure or discomfort that will soon vanish, and you won’t even remember it.
- You're listening to an "inner voice" that’s spewing nonsense unrelated to reality.
- You're perceiving reality as something other than an illusion.
- You're viewing other people as the source of your misfortunes.
- You're not mindful of your mortality, your place in the universe, let alone the emptiness of reality from concepts.

# Being in a clouded state of mind, you create bad karma

- People in a clouded state of mind create an immense amount of suffering. If you remain in this state, you stay among them: you're no better than the worst person you can think of — the differences are purely environmental.
  - Bad karma will bring you bad consequences.
  - Bad karma will multiply suffering in the world.

# Get out now!

- Focus on the present moment; it’s all you have.
- Remember that all your experiences are just images, phantoms, and shells. Observe how they arise and disappear. Where do they arise and disappear?
- Shift your attention to your breath.
- Reflect on the non-existence of the past and future. Why worry about them?
- Reflect on the fleeting nature of everything happening. Why worry about it?
- Reflect on the limitations of your ordinary perception (no focus on the inevitability of death, no focus on your place in the universe, although these things are far more important than what you’ll have for breakfast; consider that even a fish believes it understands reality as it is).
- Reflect on the fact that external things and other people cannot make you happy or unhappy, that this is your choice (think about the unrealistic expectations you have of close ones, who are also clouded souls).
- Reflect on the happiness of being born as a human in the 21st century.

# Quick self-check
